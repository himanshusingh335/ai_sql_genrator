In February 2025, you exceeded your budgets in three spending categories. Specifically, in the Food category, you went over budget by ₹2.00, with a total spend of ₹3,002.00 against a budget of ₹3,000.00. The Home category saw a more significant overshoot, exceeding the budget by ₹613.00; you spent ₹20,113.00 compared to the allotted ₹19,500.00. Notably, in the Other category, there was no budget set (₹0.00), yet you spent ₹2,475.00, resulting in an over-budget amount of ₹2,475.00. These findings suggest a need to revisit your budgeting for the Home and Other categories to better align with actual spending patterns, especially since Other had no predefined budget. The Food category’s slight overage indicates fairly tight budget management there. Overall, these insights can help you adjust your future budgets to avoid overspending.
