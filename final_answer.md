The total number of expense entries recorded in the 'Home' category within your budget tracker is 30. This means there have been 30 separate spending instances logged under 'Home', which could include rent, utilities, maintenance, or other home-related costs. If you would like, I can help break down the total amount spent or analyze trends over time in this category to give you a clearer picture of your home expenses. Would you like me to provide a summary of the total money spent on 'Home' or insights into how these expenses are distributed?
